# Trading-bot-for-the-Binance
Note: This is just an example of a simple trading bot that buys or sells based on the current price of Bitcoin in US dollars. In a real-world scenario, you would need to replace <APIKEY> with your own Binance API key, and you may also want to add additional logic to ensure that you're making informed trading decisions. Additionally, you would need to handle error cases and ensure that the bot is able to handle any exceptions that may occur while trading.
